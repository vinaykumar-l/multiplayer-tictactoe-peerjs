# Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the **Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe** game, where you can challenge your friends and prove who's the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe champion. This project is built using [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) for peer-to-peer communication, ensuring a seamless and real-time multiplayer experience.

## Background

I stumbled upon the PeerJS package while exploring the internet and decided to experiment with it. At that time, I wasn't familiar with React, so I dove into the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and found the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial. After implementing the UI from the tutorial, I wanted to take it to the next level by adding a multiplayer feature. That's when I decided to use PeerJS to enable real-time gameplay between two players.

## Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Challenge your friends in real-time and show them who's boss.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Uses PeerJS to establish a direct connection between players.
- **Responsive Design**: Works flawlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple UI**: Clean, intuitive, and ready for action.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **PeerJS**: For peer-to-peer communication.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
